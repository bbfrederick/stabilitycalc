Todo/roadmap

This is the first step towards a (hopefully not to far off) goal of
making an autonomous fMRI stability tracking server.  I'm basically
trying to reimplement a system we have working in our lab, which is
a dicom server that accepts stability datasets pushed from our scanner,
 converts to NIFTI, calculates individual scan stability parameters,
and maintains a webpage that summarizes current performance, and tracks
performance over time.  The current system is a mishmash of python,
csh scripts, cron jobs, and OSX dicom utilities, and part of freesurfer
(mri_convert).  At some point in the future, I'd like to have a virtual
Neurodebian box off in the ether somwhere that could be set up with
just a few packages that would do the same thing.

Step 1 (done): Pull the central element of the package, the actual
stability processing program out and strip it of any McLean specific
references to make it more configurable.  This can be cleaned up, but
the goal was to get it out there so that people could play with it.

Step 2: Do the same for "stabilitysummary", the program that generates
the summary webpage.

Step 3: Find a way to integrate all of this with some existing DICOM
service - XNAT?  I'm open to suggestions here.
